### Task-2
I have prior experience with Laravel framework for backend operations & Postgresql on DBeaver for database operations. This task gave me a chance to refresh my Javascript/Node knowledge. 
I found Node very easy to pickup since I have very strong familiarity with Javascript.

## Functional Requirements
I used VPN to get around the issue of 'Daily API Calls limit reached'

# Write code inside php file which fetches data from the API and prints the values of ‘API’ decreasing alphabetically
Node js file has been created that fetches the data and gets the APIs value in alpha-descending order. Axios library has been used to fetch the data and sorting algo has been created to sort the data. Various operations of Array/string conversions/extractions have been done.

● The file accepts two arguments ‘category’ and ‘limit’
The file does accept 2 arguments 'category' and 'limit'.

● Print the results matching the ‘category’ and ‘limit’ is the number of results to
print eg: php file.php Weather 5
Matching result gets printed

● If no records matches the category, print ‘No results’
In case no records matches, 'No results Found' is printed.



### Task-3
As for task 3, I wrote the code to achieve the requirement. I did not have a good setup to test my query and therefore this is the task where I believe I can learn and make corrections.

# Created Tables
I have written the code to create all the tables. I believe these code can be optimized more which I am happy to learn.

# Wrote the SQL
SQL code has been penned down. Not having a proper setup to test, it may be the case that the solution need some work.
